# 🔥 HVAC Forecasting System with Duration & Clustering Optimization (Blue Star R&D)

This project implements a robust machine learning system to forecast personalized HVAC (Air Conditioning) usage patterns including temperature setpoint, duration, fan speed, and mode for each user using synthetic minute-level data.

Developed during my internship at **Blue Star India's R&D Division**, this project also includes scalable **user clustering using K-Means** to allow grouped behavioral modeling for production-scale deployment.

## 💡 Key Features

- 🧠 Multi-Layer Forecasting: STL + ARIMA for temperature prediction using cyclical decomposition.
- ⏱️ Duration Prediction: Gradient boosting, Random Forest & XGBoost with MAE, RMSE, MAPE evaluation.
- 🔌 AC ON/OFF Detection: Simulates realistic ON/OFF patterns with contextual gap-based OFF insertion.
- 🔁 KMP + Autocorrelation: Detects prominent periodic ON/OFF cycles per user (daily, weekly, monthly).
- 🔍 K-Means Clustering: Scalable user segmentation for multi-model personalization (supports K=150+).
- 📈 Minute-Level Simulation: Fully synthetic data generator with real-world seasonality profiles.
